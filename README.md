# Movie Search Web App (Python & HTML):
This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for movies using keywords.
 Built with Python for the backend and HTML for the frontend, users can input a movie title and retrieve matching results including movie names, release years, and movie posters. The application fetches data from the OMDB API using the user's search term, and the retrieved movie information is displayed in a clean and user-friendly format. Users can sort through the search results and get basic information about movies without the need for additional clicks. The app leverages the OMDB API for movie data and provides an accessible way for users to find relevant movie details.
